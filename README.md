Welcome to Akrasia!
If you’ve ever found yourself having trouble starting a project on time or sticking to a plan to complete it, then you’re familiar with the stress that procrastination can bring. You’re not alone in this either; dozens of studies from all sorts of different research groups have been conducted on this subject, and while the numbers vary, the result is the same between all of them – procrastination is much more common than you might think.

It was this realization that led our team to create this website. We wanted to develop a tool that’s easy to use and could help students create schedules that are easy to stick to. Through our own experiences, we learned that the smallest obstacle can seem insurmountable to a procrastinator, so our aim was to ensure that using this website to manage your projects was as seamless as possible. Using Akrasia, nothing will get in the way of you and your work!
