Welcome to Akrasia!
If you’ve ever found yourself having trouble starting a project on time or sticking to a plan to complete it, then you’re familiar with the stress that procrastination can bring. You’re not alone in this either; dozens of studies from all sorts of different research groups have been conducted on this subject, and while the numbers vary, the result is the same between all of them – procrastination is much more common than you might think.

It was this realization that led our team to create this website. We wanted to develop a tool that’s easy to use and could help students create schedules that are easy to stick to. Through our own experiences, we learned that the smallest obstacle can seem insurmountable to a procrastinator, so our aim was to ensure that using this website to manage your projects was as seamless as possible. Using Akrasia, nothing will get in the way of you and your work!

## Signing up
Even creating an account on our profile is as easy as it gets; if you have a Google account, you're just a few clicks away from an Akrasia account. Our website integrates seamlessly with Google to use your calendar to manage your projects, so you can get alerts on them just like any other Google event.

## Profile management
Once you've signed up, your information is filled in automatically from your Google account, but you can change it as you like, and it will only affect your profile here. From here, you can set some details that will customize your experience; set which hours of the day you normally sleep, and Akrasia will schedule projects around this block of time, so you won't get alerts in the middle of your rest. Similarly, you can set two full days during the week that you would like to avoid getting alerts, and our website will schedule due dates for your projects around these days.
